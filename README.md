## Problem

Answer the questions in the notebook provided in the repository. The questions cover topics related to preprocessing on CNN and require you to perform an analysis.

## Objective

By engaging in the process of preprocessing the data through scaling and data augmentation techniques, you will have the opportunity to enhance your comprehension of the essential preprocessing steps involved in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Scaling the data enables you to bring the pixel values into an appropriate range, facilitating efficient model training. Additionally, data augmentation allows you to generate augmented training examples by applying various transformations, increasing the diversity and robustness of your dataset. This comprehensive preprocessing approach equips you with valuable insights into how to prepare and enhance your data for optimal CNN model performance.
