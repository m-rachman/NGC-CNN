## Preprocessing CNN Notebook

This Non-Graded Challenges that demonstrates various preprocessing techniques for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The notebook covers the following aspects:

1. Visualization of a Dataset: The notebook uses `matplotlib.image` to visualize one of the datasets. It also shows the shape of the image and explains the meaning of the image shape value.

2. Data Preprocessing - Scaling/Normalization: The notebook utilizes the `ImageDataGenerator` from TensorFlow to preprocess the data by scaling the pixel values between 0 and 1.

3. Visualization of Scaled Data: It demonstrates how to show one batch of the training data after scaling using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

4. Data Preprocessing - Data Augmentation: The notebook showcases data augmentation using the `ImageDataGenerator` from TensorFlow to create augmented training examples by applying random transformations.

5. Visualization of Augmented Data: It displays one batch of the training data after augmentation using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

6. Analysis of Data Augmentation: The notebook includes an analysis section that explores the advantages of using data augmentation and explains the parameters used in data augmentation.

7. Image Shape and Scaling Importance: The analysis section covers the significance of image shape and the need to scale the data before it enters the model.
